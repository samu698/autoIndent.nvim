# AutoIndent
This is a simple neovim plugin to automatically detect the indentation

## Why is this here
This plugin is here mostly because I can import it using packer
So this *will not* receive update unless i need them

## Info
This plugin was a way to learn lua plugins in vim and it is based on [https://github.com/Darazaki/indent-o-matic](indent-o-matic)
